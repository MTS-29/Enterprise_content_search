I'm trying to create a new user through a vuejs form. I'm using a Rails API for the backend.
I'm using gem knock and gem bcrypt for JWT authorisation.
When I submit the form, I am getting a 422 error in the terminal. Something I've noticed is that it looks like it's trying to process this as HTML, and not json.
Started POST "/api/v1/users" for 127.0.0.1 at 2019-02-17 21:18:05 +0000
Processing by Api::V1::UsersController#create as HTML
  Parameters: {"email"=>"ui@gmail.com", "password"=>"[FILTERED]", "user"=>{"email"=>"ui@gmail.com"}}
Completed 422 Unprocessable Entity in 10ms (Views: 0.9ms | ActiveRecord: 0.0ms | Allocations: 576)

When using Insomnia, I'm able to create new user perfectly fine, which is leading me to focus on the frontend being the problem.
Further, when I remove has_secure_password from the user model, the form submits with succeeded 200, albeit without a password. 
So why is the password playing up here?
createuser.vue
<template>
  <div class="card-container">
    <div class="signup">
      <form @submit.stop.prevent="newUser">
        <input id="email" v-model="email" type ="text" name="email" class="input">
        <input id="password" v-model="password" type="password" name="password" class="input">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" class="btn-update">
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
<script>
import axios from 'axios'
export default {
  data() {
      return {
          email: '',
          password: '',
          errors: []
      }
  },

  methods: {

  newUser() {
    axios.post('http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users', {
        email: this.email,
        password: this.password
      })
      .then(res => (this.user = res.data))
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error)
      });
  },
  }
};

</script>
<style>

</style>

routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do

  namespace :api do
    namespace :v1 do
      post 'user_token' => 'user_token#create'
      resources :users
      resources :posts
      #post   '/users/create'   => 'users#create' not making a difference
      #get    '/users/current'  => 'users#current'
    end
   end
end

users_controller.rb
class Api::V1::UsersController < ApplicationController
    before_action :authenticate_user,  only: [:index, :current, :update]

    def index 
        render json: User.all, status: 200
    end

    # Call this method to check if the user is logged-in.
    # If the user is logged-in we will return the user's information.
    def current
        current_user.update!(last_login: Time.now)
        render json: current_user
    end

    #def show
    #   @user = User.find(params[:id])
    #
    #    render json: User.find(params[:id]), status: 200
    #end

    def create
        user = User.new(user_params)

        if user.save
            render json: user, status: :created, location: user
        else
            render json: user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
        end
    end

    def update
        if @user.update(user_params)
          render :show, status: :ok, location: @user
        else
          render json: @user.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
        end
    end

    def destroy
        @user.destroy
    end

private
    def set_user
        @user = User.find(params[:id])
    end

    def user_params
        params.require(:user).permit(:email, :password, :avatar)
    end
end

UPDATE
I've added a default option to the API namespace.
namespace :api, defaults: {format: :json}
This has 'corrected' the processing as JSON:
Processing by Api::V1::UsersController#create as JSON

But I still get 422 Code.

You are logging the error response on the browser, in axios carch. You should look in  response.data for error reporting, according to your create method.

You need to wrap post data in user object
{
  "user":
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "password"
  }
}

You can change your request
axios.post('http://localhost:3001/api/v1/users', {
    user: {
      email: this.email,
      password: this.password
    }
  })
  .then(res => (this.user = res.data))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error)
  });
